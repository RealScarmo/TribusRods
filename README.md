# TribusRods
### About
This is a Fishing-Rods plugin developed for my minecraft-server, TribusMC.
### Why are you using PlaceholderAPI to get a players amount of tokens?
I'm using PlaceholderAPI to get the amount of tokens that a player has, because the API for the Tokens plugin is not working. This is also why I'm using commands from the console to remove tokens from a player.
