# TribusRods
###About
This is a Fishing-Rods plugin created for my server, TribusMC.
### If you are wondering why I'm using PlaceholderAPI to get the amount of tokens a player has:
I'm using PlaceholderAPI to get the amount of tokens that a player has, because the API for the Tokens plugin is not working. This is also why I'm using commands from the console to remove tokens from a player.
